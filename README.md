# A5-Reflection
###### Our reflection report


## 1) Process of developing the tool 
### Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis? 
#### Anja

#### Rene
Without the course process, the final product would not have been usable, so yes, the course processes have definitely prepared one to produce a satisfactory handover report. 

Without knowledge of ISO 19650 and the importance of its use, a task of this type would not be possible to carry out. the course has given a basic knowledge of the industry's deficient descriptions and different working modes. 

The process has clarified how much the construction industry needs BIM to be organized and optimize the various processes. 

After I have done a work placement with a concrete contractor, I have tried on my own to calculate a given quantity of concrete, after which that quantity must be ordered from a third party, where the result has been wrong. Here, I have experienced how many problems it can cause even if you have carried out thorough and well-worked calculations 

Primarily this has meant that we in the group have focused on the importance of quick and accurate quantity calculation 
#### Vahid

### Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases? 
#### Anja

#### Rene
I definitely think that it has been a great advantage for us to have had so much freedom to come up with a use case ourselves. 

In this way it has been possible to bring one's own professional problems into the case, this has made the case one's own and the ownership has forced one to think more than if the case had been more locked from your side. 
#### Vahid

### Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? 
#### Anja

#### Rene
for me, this course has been a proper introduction to completely new programs and the world of programming. so whether there have been too many tools,? I probably didn't think so since  
- if so which ones would you leave out? 

I find it satisfying to know about the various tools and have the opportunity to tinker with it myself and choose how it suits me best 
#### Vahid


## 2) Output of the tool 
### did the tool address the use case you identified? 
#### Anja

#### Rene
I definitely think that this tool addresses our use case. we have been looking for a tool that could quickly and easily tell the different quantities of the respective building parts.  

To start with, our desire was to perform our use case for an HTML forum but chose to stay in a format we were more familiar with, Excel. in the excel we get information on specific building parts and merge it with Molio's price book, which fulfils our initial wish. 
#### Vahid

### was the use case well modelled 
#### Anja

#### Rene
I think it is well modeled. our result for our tool gives a quick and precise description of the building parts and times the cost price from molio, which gives a realistic picture of a price both for the execution part and the material. a tool that could practically be taken out into reality and used in small projects. 
#### Vahid

### was the project clearly scoped 
#### Anja

#### Rene
whether the project has been clearly scoped from the start is, of course, another question. because I thought that after you gained more and more knowledge in the course, we changed our scope continuously as we acquired new knowledge about programming, and perhaps became more realistic in relation to our abilities. at the start of the course, the scope was reasonably small, but it quickly turned into far too extensive, where, in tandem with the knowledge learning course, we were able to adjust the scope to a realistic and meaningful product 
#### Vahid


## 3) Future 
### Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis 
#### Anja

#### Rene
it will clearly be smaller parts that I will use in the future, the importance of a uniform and clear description of building parts and how important common naming is. 
#### Vahid

### Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years? 
#### Anja

#### Rene
I think 100% that I will use forms of OpenBIM and hopefully have opportunities to be an active role in getting it used in small and medium sized companies, I didn't think that the full potential of 

openBIM is clarified and visualized for the wider industry  yet, at least not as widespread as it should be. I may have had a hunch that reality has a lot of difficulty in adopting the new technologists, so if you are unsure about your area, the chief executive would not accept a tool offered, and you really have to be sharp to convince future managers of the importance of undeveloped tools 
#### Vahid
